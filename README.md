# print-lang

**NOTE**: This is just en experiment, nothing actually done or working yet. Documentation on how to setup everything coming at a later time. Things will change and evolve over time. This is for learning how to make a custom language and compiler and how everything works together.

The goal of this project is to make a compiler that compiles custom language source code to LLVM IR. IR is then compiled to machine code and generate executables that print something to STDOUT.
